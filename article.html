    <p class="par" id="par1">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
    <p class="par" id="par2">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br>
      It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
    <p class="par" id="par3">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br> 
      The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
